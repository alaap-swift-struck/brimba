# Operations — brimba

How this project ships. /ship-staging and /ship-production read the config below.

## Deploy config

- platform: cloudflare-workers (gateway worker serves the app + routes /api)
- staging_url: https://brimba-staging.swift-struck.workers.dev
- production_url: https://brimba.swift-struck.workers.dev
- build_command: npm run build (root; builds web/ static export to web/out)
- deploy_staging_command: npm run deploy:staging (root; builds + deploys brimba-auth-staging then brimba-staging)
- deploy_production_command: npm run deploy:production (root; builds + deploys brimba-auth then brimba)
- github_remote: origin (https://github.com/alaap-swift-struck/brimba)

## Reset config

The /reset-all skill reads this. DESTRUCTIVE — wipes data back to empty.

- reset_command: node scripts/reset-all.mjs <staging|production|both>
- global_db_staging: brimba-core-staging
- global_db_production: brimba-core
- what it does: deletes every team database THIS project's global `teams` table
  references (never other projects' DBs), then removes all rows from the global
  core DB while keeping the schema + d1_migrations. Self-tests with a read-back.

## The pieces

| Worker | Staging name | Production name | What it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| gateway (`workers/gateway`) | brimba-staging | brimba | The front door: serves web/out + routes /api/* via service bindings |
| auth (`workers/auth`) | brimba-auth-staging | brimba-auth | Login (strict email codes only), sessions, users |

| D1 database | Bound to | Migrations |
|---|---|---|
| brimba-core-staging | brimba-auth-staging | `cd workers/auth && npx wrangler d1 migrations apply brimba-core-staging --env staging --remote` |
| brimba-core | brimba-auth | `cd workers/auth && npx wrangler d1 migrations apply brimba-core --remote` |

Deploy order when several change: auth → tenancy → gateway (root scripts do this).
A nightly cron (03:10 UTC, tenancy worker) sizes every team DB and alarms at 80% of the 10GB cap.
New migrations must be applied to BOTH databases before deploying workers that need them.

## Secrets (set once per env, never in git)

- `cd workers/auth && npx wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY --env staging` (and again without `--env` for production)
- `CF_D1_TOKEN` (Account→D1→Edit) on brimba-tenancy + brimba-tenancy-staging — SET 2026-06-12 (team creation live). `ADMIN_KEY` (maintenance endpoints: migrate-teams, db-sizes, move-module) — SET on both envs 2026-06-12; rotate anytime with `wrangler secret put ADMIN_KEY`.
- Until RESEND_API_KEY is set: staging echoes login codes in the API response (DEV_ECHO_CODES=1); production refuses email login.

### Resend (real login emails) — production wiring

The send code is built (`workers/auth/src/lib/email.ts`); it needs two things,
both owner-only:

1. **API key** — create at resend.com → API Keys (Sending access). Set it:
   `cd workers/auth && npx wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY` (prod) and again
   with `--env staging`. The moment it's set, real emails send and the staging
   echo stops.
2. **Verified sender domain** — `onboarding@resend.dev` (the current default
   `EMAIL_FROM`) only delivers to the Resend account owner's own inbox, so it's
   fine for our own testing but NOT for real users. To email anyone: in Resend
   add a domain (e.g. `mail.swiftstruck.com`), add the DKIM/SPF records it shows
   to that domain's DNS in Cloudflare, then set `EMAIL_FROM` in
   `workers/auth/wrangler.jsonc` to e.g. `Brimba <login@mail.swiftstruck.com>`
   and redeploy.

## Verify before shipping

- npm run check   (type-checks web + all workers, runs all 21 unit/integration tests)
- CI runs the same on every push (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- deploy:staging ends with scripts/smoke-staging.mjs — the LIVE login→team journey must pass or the deploy is considered failed

## Local dev

- `npm run dev:auth` (auth worker on :8787, local DB; first time: apply migrations with `--local`)
- `npm run dev` (web on :3000; /api proxies to :8787)

## Notes

- The UI library (`@swift-struck/ui`) installs from GitHub. Update: `npm install github:alaap-swift-struck/swift-struck-ui`.
- `web/app/globals.css` is a COPY of the library theme (master: swift-struck-ui repo, www/app/globals.css). Its `@source` points at the ROOT node_modules (workspaces hoist).
- Missing UI components are placeholdered in `web/components/temp/` and tracked in UI-GAPS.md — the library absorbs them, then placeholders get deleted.
