// THE LAWS OF THE BASE, as data. This is the single source of truth the human
// RULES.md and the machine-checks (shared/rules + the per-worker publish-seam
// tests + web/test/rules.test.ts) are both pinned to. A law may not be added
// without a check; a check may not exist without a law (enforced by L0 in
// web/test/rules.test.ts). Deny-lists are DATA here, so every exception is a
// reviewed, visible line — never a silent bypass (the proven publish-seam pattern).
